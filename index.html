        <p>Week One has been similar to what I expected it would be to this point. I anticipated that this class would
            be a lot to take in,
            given I hadn't done any programming in 10 years coming into this, and it has certainly not disappointed in
            that regard. I am thankful
            that my time at my previous full-time position has already ended so that I am able to focus all of my
            attention onto the bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Throughout the bootcamp, I am simply excited to learn, and to learn a lot. For the past 5 years, I have been
            doing something that
            doesn't fit my personality or my natural giftings. I look forward to diving into the world of programming
            and to hopefully unlock
            something inside of me that will grow, challenge, and excite me in all the right ways. Right now, the things
            that I want to learn
            most about are making aestheically pleasing UX's and design, animation, and data analysis. As I look forward
            in this field and things
            that bring me life, these are the topics that stand out the most at this time.</p>

        <p>Something to know about me is that I have spent the past five years as an insurance agent, and the past
            number of years before that
            doing volunteer ministry outreach in an environment where most people didn't look like me. Both of those
            things are generally geared
            toward extroverts, of which I am not. I have learned so much through both about working with people, dealing
            with all different types
            of cultures and personalities, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I think those skills will benefit
            me greatly both in this
            bootcamp, and moving back into the real world in a new career where I will continue to work with teams and
            clients, just in (likely) a
            less forward-facing role. I look forward to working with my classmates and instructors throughout this
            process and watching us all
            learn and grow together.</p>

        <p>As John Calipari always says:</p>
        <blockquote>I like my team.</blockquote>
