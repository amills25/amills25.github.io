                        <p>
                            Week One has been similar to what I expected it
                            would be to this point. I anticipated that this
                            class would be a lot to take in, given I hadn't done
                            any programming in 10 years coming into this, and it
                            has certainly not disappointed in that regard. I am
                            thankful that my time at my previous full-time
                            position has already ended so that I am able to
                            focus all of my attention onto the bootcamp.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Throughout the bootcamp, I am simply excited to
                            learn, and to learn a lot. For the past 5 years, I
                            have been doing something that doesn't fit my
                            personality or my natural giftings. I look forward
                            to diving into the world of programming and to
                            hopefully unlock something inside of me that will
                            grow, challenge, and excite me in all the right
                            ways. Right now, the things that I want to learn
                            most about are making aestheically pleasing UX's and
                            design, animation, and data analysis. As I look
                            forward in this field and things that bring me life,
                            these are the topics that stand out the most at this
                            time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Something to know about me is that I have spent the
                            past five years as an insurance agent, and the past
                            number of years before that doing volunteer ministry
                            outreach in an environment where most people didn't
                            look like me. Both of those things are generally
                            geared toward extroverts, of which I am not. I have
                            learned so much through both about working with
                            people, dealing with all different types of cultures
                            and personalities, and pushing myself out of my
                            comfort zone. I think those skills will benefit me
                            greatly both in this bootcamp, and moving back into
                            the real world in a new career where I will continue
                            to work with teams and clients, just in (likely) a
                            less forward-facing role. I look forward to working
                            with my classmates and instructors throughout this
                            process and watching us all learn and grow together.

                            Week two of the bootcamp has been a really exciting
                            week that has pushed me and challenged me in a lot
                            of ways. Moving from markdown into HTML, CSS, and a
                            little bit of JS has been a big jump, but it's cool
                            to see the growth in myself and those around me as
                            everything builds upon the last. While I'm learning
                            a ton and taking in a lot of information right now,
                            there's still so much I hope to learn and develop on
                            as we move forward. I'm really interested in film
                            animation and data science, and I know skills that
                            deep won't be covered in the bootcamp, I'd like to
                            maybe create a knowledge base to help me dive deeper
                            into those skills. I want to at least learn some
                            more HTML, CSS, and JS skills to create some basic
                            animations. And while we may not learn Python and
                            the like in this bootcamp, I hope to gain skills in
                            creating functions and using logic and math to build
                            out ways to solve data equations.

                        <p>
                            My biggest struggles right now are fine tuning my
                            HTML skills and knowing what to focus on. I need to
                            improve on my ability to simply set up a webpage
                            correctly in HTML and know the exact order/format of
                            the elements and attributes to use. For instance, in
                            this week's Build exercise, I was struggling at one
                            point when correcting the format of the HTML when
                            inserting a<code>section</code>, and I ended up
                            making it an <code>article</code> before realizing
                            that it was incorrect. Beyond that, it will be nice
                            to have a larger knowledge base for coding so I can
                            try to find a niche that I want to pursue. Right
                            now, it's a lot of gathering information where I
                            have none, and I don't know what I want to do with
                            it, or what I should be focusing in on. I think that
                            will improve throughout the course of this bootcamp,
                            but it is a bit overwhelming right now.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy solving problems, and I'm learning that
                            programming never allows a lack of problems to be
                            solved. I like to think I'm pretty good at utilizing
                            my resources, and I'm thankful to have a plethora of
                            those at my disposal right now. It's key to focus in
                            on exactly what the root issue of a problem is; that
                            way you're solving for the right thing, and not
                            spraying perfume on a casket, so to speak. So far in
                            this course, I have done a lot of Googling, which I
                            hear is an important skill for any programmer.
                            Beyond that, I am thankful to be able to have my
                            classmates and instructors at my disposal in Slack
                            that I've been able to reach out to for questions. I
                            also have friends outside of this class who are
                            programmers that I know I will be able to reach out
                            to and they'll always be there for me. Thankfully, I
                            haven't had any major issues where I've needed to
                            reach out to those outside of this class, but it's a
                            great resource I know I can carry out into my future
                            programming career.

                        <p>
                            I'm really enjoying the early bits of front-end
                            development so far as we're now through our third
                            week. We've gotten into HTML and CSS for a couple of
                            weeks now, and then really dove into JavaScript over
                            this past week. It's cool the way you can link the
                            three of them together to create something complex
                            and usable. I've enjoyed the CSS and design aspect
                            of it more than I thought I would. I could spend
                            hours on just the CSS trying to make the page and
                            its features look nice. I'm still struggling with
                            JavaScript and developing functions from scratch. I
                            am a man of few words, so sometimes I struggle to
                            give every detail when I write, and in JavaScript,
                            you can't skip over anything or your function will
                            fail. I can make sense of the logic, but I just need
                            more practice in creating it all myself and figure
                            out patterns so I can improve my code-writing skills
                            and not skip anything over.

                            When it comes to my blog, I am still using only
                            Markdown, so I haven't yet incorporated any
                            <code>objects</code>. I look forward to soon
                            converting it into HTML in the very least and using
                            objects to display photos and videos so I can better
                            express myself and my work through my blog posts.

                            I hear that week four will incorporate a lot of
                            pseudo coding, and I am a little nervous about that.
                            Like I said before, I generally use as few words as
                            possible in my communication, so it's not natural
                            for me to write pseudocode before I have to go write
                            real code. So far, my pseudocode has been the most
                            basic of outlines, and when I see others', I see how
                            much room for improvement I have in that regard.
                            That said, I think it will be a very good skill to
                            improve upon so that I can better organize my code
                            when I get into bigger projects. It will take
                            discipline from me in taking the time to do good
                            pseudocode, but it seems like it'll be worth it in
                            the long run.

                            Throughout the first four weeks of bootcamp (the
                            Onboarding phase), I got to work from home, which
                            has it's pros and cons. I absolutely love being able
                            to work at my own pace and be able to step outside
                            my own home at will when I need to step away from
                            the computer screen. As for the bootcamp itself, I
                            thought we were set up really well for success given
                            the fully remote status. I appreciated the
                            activities that were more "handholding", because
                            where I have a lack of coding knowledge, it really
                            helps me to see someone else's steps and follow
                            along to create something. The videos from the
                            instructors were really helpful as a whole also,
                            because it's one thing to read text and try to
                            interpret it; it's another thing to have an expert
                            on a subject walk you through their thought process
                            and understanding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I felt hindered coming into bootcamp by having
                            little to no coding experience prior. Having to take
                            in a lot of information from reading on my own, it's
                            hard to fully grasp something when it's foreign to
                            you. On top of that, working on my own didn't help.
                            When I would get stuck on something, it was easy to
                            get in my own head and feel like I'm drowning and
                            have no one there to pick me up. I look forward to
                            having fellow bootcampers in the room with me so we
                            can better relate to what each is going through and
                            encourage one another along the way.

                            While Onboarding wasn't all sunshine and rainbows,
                            I'm thankful to have an incredible support system
                            around me to encourage me and to keep things in
                            perspective. Even on the most challenging days,
                            having a daily Stand-Up meeting with bootcampers
                            helped remind me that I'm not alone in this. This
                            week, we had the opportunity to attend a meetup even
                            with current and former bootcampers, and it was nice
                            to get to talk to some fellow bootcampers and relate
                            to them outside of purely coding, and it felt good
                            to see the positivity and feel the encouragement of
                            past bootcampers. Lastly, I'm thankful for my
                            friends and family who continue to push me and
                            encourage me through this trying season of life in
                            being unemployed and changing careers altogether.
                            Regardless of what kind of job I end up with, what
                            languanges I'll have to learn about, and what
                            blockers I face each day, I have people in my life
                            that aren't going anywhere that I know I can turn to
                            be uplifted.

                            Week 5 came in like a wrecking ball after our four
                            weeks of virtual Onboarding. I'm starting to get a
                            solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JS functions, but this
                            week we introduced Bootstrap and the idea of State
                            Management. I like Bootstrap when I have the
                            creative freedom to make a page the way I want, but
                            when it comes to using Bootstrap to make a page
                            match an existing design, my lack of experience with
                            it held me back quite a bit. The biggest thing that
                            held me back though, was trying to wrap my mind
                            around State Management. It took me a few days to
                            grasp what that really means and how it relates to
                            code and that slowed me down in setting up this
                            week's big project. I liked the analogy of liquid
                            water and changing its state to a gas or solid while
                            maintaining the same elements. That helped me think
                            through our project and changing the view of a
                            single-page application's attributes while keeping
                            the same elements throughout once it clicked.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm picking up on the JS basics, but there's so much
                            more to know that I don't even know about yet; the
                            unknown unknown, so to speak. Things I do know I am
                            looking forward to learning more about objects and
                            classes and how to use them in my code. We've seen
                            them, and I see the benefit, but I don't have a lot
                            of practice there yet, so I look forward to more of
                            that. I also look forward to learning about maps and
                            other methods that allow us to shorten and
                            consolidate our code.

                            It's been great being in-person compared to remote.
                            I've learning so much more simply by collaborating
                            and conversing with those around me in class. There
                            are so many different ways to go about the same
                            problem in code, so it's been fun to see that and
                            try to understand the different methods. The best
                            part of being in-person has been having the
                            instructors here, though. It's incredibly beneficial
                            to have folks so much more knowledgeable than me
                            giving me hints or showing me what to think about or
                            how pieces of code work together.

                            There were times this week that I felt absolutely
                            defeated and I had to sit back and take a deep
                            breath and put everything into perspective for a
                            minute. It's my wife that keeps me going. I've been
                            through the gauntlet with jobs over the past couple
                            of years, and she's had to continually sacrifice for
                            me because we have to make changes financially. I
                            don't want her to have to do that any longer, and I
                            don't want to force her to carry the load for us to
                            stay afloat. This bootcamp is giving me the
                            opportunity to take stress off of her, and set
                            myself and my family up for future success. I can't
                            wait!

                            I've always struggled with being patient when I'm
                            working on projects; I just want to dive into things
                            and get to work. Because of this, the development
                            process of coding is a challenge for me. I was
                            always the kid who got in trouble in math class for
                            not showing their work. And for a 10-page research
                            paper, I may do a half-page of the most basic
                            outline. I'm learning (the hard way, at times) that
                            coding has a development process to be followed, and
                            it has its serious benefits.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to develop good code, you have to be
                            willing to make multiple iterations. I need to be
                            more patient with the process, taking things
                            step-by-step, embracing the brainstorming and
                            pseudocoding, and admitting I can't just dive into a
                            project and immediately know everything and get it
                            done and functional right away.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A good developer certainly embraces the process. You
                            have to be willing to learn, willing to adapt,
                            willing to collaborate, and willing to listen. You
                            will have to accept the fact that things won't be
                            perfect right away. If you're being selfish, or try
                            to get into code before you have it properly planned
                            out, you're going to fail and you're going to end up
                            working even more in the long run.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I can't speak for all programmers, because I am
                            hardly one myself, but I know the part of the
                            process that I hate the most is pseudocode. I rarely
                            am able to get past my first iteration of
                            pseudocoding because once it starts to look more
                            like code, I'd rather just go ahead and turn it into
                            real code! Once I get more experience in coding, I
                            may be able to better think through my process, but
                            for now, I'll get more out of practicing real code,
                            than I would planning out pseudocode for processes

                            Computer programming is a lot more than just writing
                            code. If you jump directly into code when presented
                            with a new project, you're likely to end up with
                            numerous bugs and create more work for yourself. It
                            is best practice, instead, to write pseudocode
                            before actual code. Pseudocode is merely writing out
                            the patterns, steps, and algorithms of a program in
                            plain English.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By doing this, you can logically think through your
                            program and decide how you want to make it work,
                            which can then be translated into any coding
                            language you want. I like to incorporate a little
                            bit of real code in mine and start translating
                            pieces as I think them through because I know I'll
                            have to do so eventually, but for many, keeping it
                            in plain English is most beneficial. In those cases,
                            you could hand your pseudocode to someone who
                            doesn't know anything about programming, and they
                            would be able to read and understand what your
                            program is going to do
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Having been recently introduced to Object Oriented
                            Programming, I found that my pseudocode really
                            helped me more than it had in the past. When you are
                            working with objects and classes in JavaScript, it
                            is vitally important to properly organize your
                            thoughts and your code methods. Otherwise, you will
                            get lost, pieces won't connect, and your program
                            will be full of bugs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I didn't expect, though, was that Object
                            Oriented Programming helped me with my pseudocode.
                            Knowing that my program needed to be properly
                            organized to function correctly, I was better able
                            to write pseudocode knowing I had to decide in
                            advance where pieces of code would be and how they
                            would connect.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This method of organization is better known as a{" "}
                            <i>design pattern.</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This week in web developer bootcamp, we were
                            introduced to design patterns for the first time.
                            While we used a couple of them, including
                            Model-View-Controller, my preferred design pattern
                            at this time is the Composite pattern. In the
                            composite pattern, you "compose" objects into
                            "parent" and "child" structures so you can treat
                            each of them as one. Much like a human child
                            inherits attributes from their parents, this coding
                            design pattern acts in a similar fashion. Your
                            parent component can make requests from its child
                            and it can act accordingly because it has inherited
                            the same traits as the parent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another way to look at this pattern is with a tree
                            and leaves. The main object component of your
                            program is the tree and a leaf is another object
                            that inherits the traits of the tree and can do
                            actions at the request of the tree. As a parent with
                            multiple child objects, or a tree with multiple leaf
                            objects, it would make sense to have a method in
                            your main component that would run on each of the
                            children at the same time to create the same effect
                            on each of them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Naturally, with having dozens of design patterns
                            available, there are good and bad times to use this
                            particular one. You would choose the composite
                            pattern if you are using multiple objects in the
                            same way, and know you're going to have very similar
                            code to work on each of them. Each child is going to
                            inherit attributes from the parent, therefore you
                            are able to work similarly on each of them. I found
                            it beneficial this week when creating a Tic-Tac-Toe
                            game to use this pattern because I created a game
                            object as a parent, and a tile object as a child. If
                            I had decided to use 4 different objects that each
                            work in different ways, then another design method
                            may have been a better choice, but we'll save that
                            for another day!

                        <p>
                            This week, we were first introduced to the React
                            JavaScript library, and it was A LOT. I don't think
                            the content itself is particuarly easy to hard to
                            understand, it's just new, and there's a lot of it.
                            It will take lots of practice and getting used to,
                            but I believe it will be worth it. I like how
                            well-organized all the pieces of a program are
                            within React, and I love how quickly things render
                            to the page; it makes troubleshooting and taking
                            things a step at a time much easier.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I look forward to diving much deeper into React as
                            time goes on. I know it is incredibly dynamic and
                            oft-used, so it's something I should get used to.
                            Unfortunately for right now, you don't know what you
                            don't know, and it will just take time and practice
                            to get good at it. It will be an incredibly valuable
                            skill to be proficient in moving forward, so I know
                            it needs to be a focus of mine throughout bootcamp
                            and beyond.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As I move forward through bootcamp and on, I want to
                            learn a lot more about npm packages and hope to
                            incorporate them into my final project. Open-source
                            code is an incredible tool to have and surely saves
                            time, money, and effort in projects. We have used a
                            couple of packages from npm so far, so I look
                            forward to seeing what else they have to offer that
                            coule be beneficial over time and for larger
                            projects.

                        <p>
                            From day one of bootcamp, we've had to learn how to
                            work in a command line interface (CLI), and I've
                            thought it was scary from that first moment. I
                            always thought of the command line as where
                            professional hackers do their work, and not
                            something I needed to be versed in. Even though I've
                            learned how to work in the CLI in the context of
                            Git, the unknown of how much else it can do is
                            intimidating.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I could build my own CLI, I would have it make
                            the process of pushing to GitHub a lot more
                            streamlined. It's time consuming to continually have
                            to "git add", "git commit", and "git push", then
                            switch branches and pull and push again. I would
                            like to create a command that will add and commit at
                            once. Then another command that would pull from a
                            dev branch then push up to GitHub at once. It would
                            not only save time, but also help me not to miss
                            steps in getting everything I've done correctly onto
                            my GitHub.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Last week, we started working with the React
                            framework, and without a framework like that, I
                            wouldn't even know where to begin with creating a
                            multi-page website. That may just be my
                            inexperience, but we've only done single-page
                            applications with Vanilla JavaScript, but within
                            React I can see how we would go beyond that. Without
                            that framework, it seems like it would be very
                            difficult to create multiple pages with multiple
                            classes/components, so I am thankful for the
                            experience learning the React framework!
