*Week One*

* Week One has been similar to what I expected it would be to this point. I anticipated that this class would be a lot to take in, given I hadn't done any programming in 10 years coming into this, and it has certainly not disappointed in that regard. I am thankful that my time at my previous full-time position has already ended so that I am able to focus all of my attention onto the bootcamp.
* Throughout the bootcamp, I am simply excited to learn, and to learn **a lot**. For the past 5 years, I have been doing something that doesn't fit my personality or my natural giftings. I look forward to diving into the world of programming and to hopefully unlock something inside of me that will grow, challenge, and excite me in all the right ways. Right now, the things that I want to learn most about are making aestheically pleasing UX's and design, animation, and data analysis. As I look forward in this field and things that bring me life, these are the topics that stand out the most at this time.
* Something to know about me is that I have spent the past five years as an insurance agent, and the past number of years before that doing volunteer ministry outreach in an environment where most people didn't look like me. Both of those things are generally geared toward extroverts, of which I am not. I have learned so much through both about working with people, dealing with all different types of cultures and personalities, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I think those skills will benefit me greatly both in this bootcamp, and moving back into the real world in a new career where I will continue to work with teams and clients, just in (likely) a less forward-facing role. I look forward to working with my classmates and instructors throughout this process and watching us all learn and grow together.

  * As Coach John Calipari always says:

*Week Two*

* Week two of the bootcamp has been a really exciting week that has pushed me and challenged me in a lot of ways. Moving from markdown into HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS has been a big jump, but it's cool to see the growth in myself and those around me as everything builds upon the last. While I'm learning a ton and taking in a lot of information right now, there's still so much I hope to learn and develop on as we move forward. **I'm really interested in film animation and data science**, and I know skills that deep won't be covered in the bootcamp, I'd like to maybe create a knowledge base to help me dive deeper into those skills. I want to at least learn some more HTML, CSS, and JS skills to create some basic animations. And while we may not learn Python and the like in this bootcamp, I hope to gain skills in creating functions and using logic and math to build out ways to solve data equations.

* **My biggest struggles right now are fine tuning my HTML skills and knowing what to focus on**. I need to improve on my ability to simply set up a webpage correctly in HTML and know the exact order/format of the elements and attributes to use. For instance, in this week's Build exercise, I was struggling at one point when correcting the format of the HTML when inserting a `<section>`, and I ended up making it an `<article>` before realizing that it was incorrect. Beyond that, it will be nice to have a larger knowledge base for coding so I can try to find a niche that I want to pursue. Right now, it's a lot of gathering information where I have none, and I don't know what I want to do with it, or what I should be focusing in on. I think that will improve throughout the course of this bootcamp, but it is a bit overwhelming right now.

* I enjoy solving problems, and I'm learning that programming never allows a lack of problems to be solved. I like to think I'm pretty good at utilizing my resources, and I'm thankful to have a plethora of those at my disposal right now. **It's key to focus in on exactly what the root issue of a problem is; that way you're solving for the right thing**, and not spraying perfume on a casket, so to speak. So far in this course, I have done a lot of Googling, which I hear is an important skill for any programmer. Beyond that, I am thankful to be able to have my classmates and instructors at my disposal in Slack that I've been able to reach out to for questions. I also have friends outside of this class who are programmers that I know I will be able to reach out to and they'll always be there for me. Thankfully, I haven't had any major issues where I've needed to reach out to those outside of this class, but it's a great resource I know I can carry out into my future programming career.
