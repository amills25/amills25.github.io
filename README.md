*Week One*

* Week One has been similar to what I expected it would be to this point. I anticipated that this class would be a lot to take in, given I hadn't done any programming in 10 years coming into this, and it has certainly not disappointed in that regard. I am thankful that my time at my previous full-time position has already ended so that I am able to focus all of my attention onto the bootcamp.
* Throughout the bootcamp, I am simply excited to learn, and to learn **a lot**. For the past 5 years, I have been doing something that doesn't fit my personality or my natural giftings. I look forward to diving into the world of programming and to hopefully unlock something inside of me that will grow, challenge, and excite me in all the right ways. Right now, the things that I want to learn most about are making aestheically pleasing UX's and design, animation, and data analysis. As I look forward in this field and things that bring me life, these are the topics that stand out the most at this time.
* Something to know about me is that I have spent the past five years as an insurance agent, and the past number of years before that doing volunteer ministry outreach in an environment where most people didn't look like me. Both of those things are generally geared toward extroverts, of which I am not. I have learned so much through both about working with people, dealing with all different types of cultures and personalities, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I think those skills will benefit me greatly both in this bootcamp, and moving back into the real world in a new career where I will continue to work with teams and clients, just in (likely) a less forward-facing role. I look forward to working with my classmates and instructors throughout this process and watching us all learn and grow together.

  * As Coach John Calipari always says:
